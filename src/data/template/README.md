# Creating New Games

This folder contains a template for creating new games. To add a new game:

## 1. Create a new folder under `src/data/`

Create a folder with your game name (e.g., `restaurant`, `tech-startup`, `coffee-shop`)

## 2. Create the game file

Create a single `index.ts` file that contains all your game data:

```typescript
import { Scenario, GameState, Game } from '@/types/game';

// All the decision scenarios for your game
export const yourGameScenarios: Scenario[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Your First Decision",
    description: "Description of the scenario...",
    decisions: [
      {
        text: "Option 1",
        description: "What this option does",
        effects: { money: -1000, health: 5, users: 10 }
      },
      // ... more decisions
    ]
  },
  // ... more scenarios
];

// Complete game configuration with metadata and game settings
export const yourGame: Game = {
  id: 'your-game-id',
  name: 'Your Game Name',
  description: 'Description of your game',
  // UI Metadata
  emoji: 'ðŸš€',
  colors: 'from-blue-500/10 to-purple-500/10 border-blue-200',
  vision: "Your vision statement for the game...",
  mission: "Your mission statement for the game...",
  goal: (winMoney: number, winQuality: number) => 
    `Reach $${(winMoney / 1000).toFixed(0)}K in revenue with high-quality products (${winQuality}%+) to achieve success.`,
  // Game Configuration
  initialGameState: {
    money: 5000,
    health: 100,
    mentalPeace: 100,
    teamMorale: 100,
    productQuality: 50,
    users: 0,
    day: 1,
    currentScenario: 0,
    gameOver: false,
    endReason: '',
    seenScenarios: [],
    scenarioHistory: []
  },
  scenarios: yourGameScenarios,
  gameOverConditions: {
    money: 0,
    health: 0,
    mentalPeace: 0,
    teamMorale: 0,
    productQuality: 0,
    users: 0
  },
  winConditions: {
    money: 500000,
    productQuality: 85
  }
};
```

## 3. Register your game

Add your game to the game manager in `src/lib/gameManager.ts`:

```typescript
import { yourGame } from '../data/your-game';

// In the constructor:
this.games.set('your-game-id', yourGame);
```

## 4. Set as current game (optional)

To make your game the default, change the `currentGameId` in the game manager:

```typescript
private currentGameId: string = 'your-game-id';
```

## Example Game Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fitflow/           # Fitness app game
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts       # All fitflow data in one file
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ restaurant/        # Restaurant game (example)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts       # All restaurant data in one file
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ template/          # Template for new games
â””â”€â”€ lib/
    â””â”€â”€ gameManager.ts     # Manages all games
```

## Game State Properties

The game state includes these properties that you can use in your scenarios:

- `money`: Financial resources
- `health`: Physical health
- `mentalPeace`: Mental well-being
- `teamMorale`: Team happiness
- `productQuality`: Quality of your product/service
- `users`: Number of customers/users
- `day`: Current day/week
- `currentScenario`: Index of current scenario
- `gameOver`: Whether the game has ended
- `endReason`: Reason for game ending
- `seenScenarios`: Array of scenario IDs that have been seen
- `scenarioHistory`: Array of scenario IDs in order they were played

## Game Properties

The Game interface includes both UI metadata and game configuration:

### UI Metadata:
- `emoji`: Emoji icon for your game (used in cards and headers)
- `colors`: CSS classes for gradient backgrounds and borders
- `vision`: Vision statement shown in the welcome screen
- `mission`: Mission statement shown in the welcome screen
- `goal`: Function that generates the goal text based on win conditions

### Game Configuration:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the game
- `name`: Display name for the game
- `description`: Brief description of the game
- `initialGameState`: Starting values for all game properties
- `scenarios`: Array of all decision scenarios
- `gameOverConditions`: Values that trigger game over
- `winConditions`: Values required to win the game

## Tips for Creating Games

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with 3-5 scenarios to test the flow
2. **Balance Effects**: Make sure decisions have meaningful trade-offs
3. **Progressive Difficulty**: Scenarios should get more complex over time
4. **Realistic Consequences**: Effects should make sense for the decision
5. **Multiple Paths**: Allow for different strategies to succeed
6. **Consistent Theming**: Use appropriate emojis and colors that match your game theme
